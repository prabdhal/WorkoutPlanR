# WorkoutPlanR
Workout PlanR is a website where users can view, create and publish their workout programs. Users can create workout phases and select exercises offered to them via an API to create their own custom workout programs.

Work process
The Workout PlanR website was developed to allow users to create their own workout programs with several phases and exercises within each program. Users could sign up and begin publishing their workout programs to allow other users to view their program. An exercise api was created to allow users to fetch from a list of exercises to add to their program. The exercises come with a description and a reference video link on how to do the exercise. This fully responsive website also had user registration, login, password reset, and account validation setup via the SendGrid API, which allowed sending emails to the user to confirm their account.
